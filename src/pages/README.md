# src/pages/

This directory contains **app-level pages only**, not feature pages.

## Files

- `NotFound.tsx` - 404 page (app-level)
- `ThemePreviewPage.tsx` - Utility page for theme testing
- `Tickets.tsx` - Redirect wrapper (backward compatibility)

## Convention

All feature pages should be in `src/features/*/pages/`.
This directory is only for pages that don't belong to any specific feature.
